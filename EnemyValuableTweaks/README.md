# EnemyValuableTweaks

[REVISE]
Are you sick of those moments where you've put so much effort into tossing a monster down a pit, only for the orb to bounce everywhere and break on its own without giving you a single chance to get anywhere within grabbing range?

I am, because this happened WAY TOO MANY TIMES to me. So, I decided to fix this annoyance myself with this mod.

‚ùóÔ∏è **All players must have this mod installed, and all clients must have the same config settings as the host!** Otherwise, visual desync at the very least will occur.

## ‚ùáÔ∏è Features

‚è≤Ô∏è Enable, disable, and adjust the length of the indestructible timer duration of the orb.

üí® Automatically disable indestructibility when the orb's velocity slows to a stop. This is intended to cancel the main timer if the orb has already reached a standstill, so that the orb wouldn't remain invincible for longer than it needs to.

üëê Disable indestructibility when a player grabs ahold of it, since at this point the safety of the orb is now in your hands... *get it?*

üõí Disable indestructibility when the orb has been placed in a safe area, such as the C.A.R.T. or an extraction point.

üé≤ Configure the probability of an orb exploding upon destruction for each Moon Phase! This can add a little more tension and unpredictability when handling orbs.

This mod is extensively configurable, so you can fine-tune the orb's behavior to your liking. The default configs are intended to make a slightly more fair and interesting experience than vanilla without feeling overpowered. If you *do* want to make it either completely overpowered or brutally unfair, you have all the freedom to do so!

## üöß Roadmap

- Improve multiplayer synchronization
- Automatically edit Moon Phase modifier descriptions to tell current explosion probability
- Ability to configure the amount of orbs that can be dropped per level, and perhaps even per enemy

Suggestions are welcome! Tell me what's on your mind in the [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1344557689979670578/1421636750174060635).

## üîß Configuration

Note that each category somewhat takes priority over the previous. Configs update immediately, especially while in-game if using RepoConfig.

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand config list:</summary>

- Timer
    - **EnableTimer**: Whether to enable the main timer that automatically disables indestructibility once expired. If disabled, the orb will never become destructible unless any of the following additional checks are enabled.
    - **TimerLength**: Time in seconds until the orb loses indestructibility. Vanilla default is 5 seconds.
- Additional Checks
    - **AdditionalChecksDelay**: Time in seconds before all following checks activate after the orb has initially spawned. This option reads from the main timer, and will not work if greater than **TimerLength**. Set to 0 to disable.
- Velocity
    - **EnableVelocityCheck**: Automatically disables indestructibility when the orb slows down to a certain velocity threshold. Takes precedence over the timer, meaning it will cut off the timer early if the orb has already reached a standstill.
    - **VelocityThreshold**: The minimum threshold for the velocity check.
- Player Grab
    - **EnablePlayerHold**: Automatically disables indestructibility when the orb is grabbed by a player.
    - **PlayerHoldTime**: Time in seconds that a player must continue holding onto the orb before indestructibility is disabled. Resets when the player lets go, so that it will not prematurely become destructible if the player gets distracted by something else. Can be set to 0 to immediately disable indestructibility.
- Safe Areas
    - **EnableSafeAreaCheck**: Disables indestructibility if the orb has been placed inside a safe area, such as the C.A.R.T. or an extraction point.
    - **SafeAreaTime**: Time in seconds that the orb must remain in a safe area to disable indestructibility. Works exactly like **PlayerHoldTime**.
- Moon Phase Explosion Probability
    - **InitialExplosionProbability**: The probability of orbs exploding at the start of a new game, before any moon phases have even taken effect.
    - **CrescentMoonExplosionProbability**: The probability of orbs exploding during the Crescent Moon phase, beginning on Level 5.
    - **HalfMoonExplosionProbability**: The probability of orbs exploding during the Half Moon phase, beginning on Level 10.
    - **FullMoonExplosionProbability**: The probability of orbs exploding during the Full Moon phase, beginning on Level 15.
    - **SuperMoonExplosionProbability**: The probability of orbs exploding during the Super Moon phase, beginning on Level 20.
- Debug
    - **EnableDebugTimerLogs**: Enable debug logs for this mod's timers. "Debug" or "All" must be included in Logging.Console.**LogLevels** in the BepInEx config to be able to see these logs. Note that this will create a lot of spam in the console, so please keep this disabled for normal gameplay!
    - **EnableDebugCalculationLogs**: Enable debug logs for other calculations performed by this mod. Same considerations as **EnableDebugTimerLogs**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility

This mod may potentially conflict with other mods that extensively patch the `Start()` and `Update()` methods of `EnemyValuable`.
